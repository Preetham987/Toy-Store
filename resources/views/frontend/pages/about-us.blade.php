        <p>
            As a child of the 80's, I greatly enjoyed Transformers, GI Joe, Masters of the Universe,
            and other beloved 80's properties. I drifted away from these toys as I progressed through
            school, but rediscovered my love of collecting when Beast Wars: Transformers released
            in 1996 while in college. I spent the next four years collecting, buying, and trading
            various vintage 80's toys on the fledgling internet in Usenet newsgroups. After graduating
            college in 1999, I had the summer off and decided to try selling toys full time before
            looking for a "real job".

            I started the summer with a few boxes of vintage Transformers and got to work. The summer
            was quickly consumed by purchasing large collections of figures and reselling them
            individually on eBay. These were very fun and exciting times, packing and shipping
            auctions by night. By the end of summer I had amassed a small storage unit worth of
            inventory and had shipped thousands of figures out to auction winners. I spent the next
            6 months buying and selling on eBay and then decided I needed to expand and begin selling
            brand new items at retail. It was this decision in the fall of 1999 that led to the
            formation of BigBadToyStore with my brother Dean Boblit.

            Dan created a basic ecommerce website for us in 1999 and we launched the site with a
            pallet of Beast Machines Transformers from Hasbro.
